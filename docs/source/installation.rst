Installation via pip
====================

It is strongly recommended to create a virtual environment beforehand, e.g. via conda or virtualenv.

You can then install DivBrowse from PyPI via pip::

    $ pip install divbrowse




Installation from sources on Github via conda
=============================================

You can install the latest version from the main branch of the GitHub repository with the following shell commands::

    $ git clone https://github.com/IPK-BIT/divbrowse
    $ cd divbrowse
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
